# Superstore Sales Analysis

This project explores sales, profit, customer segments and product performance using the Superstore dataset.
The goal was to build a clear and interactive Power BI report to help understand key business patterns and support decision-making.

## Dashboard Overview

The report contains three pages:

### 1. Overview

- Key performance indicators (Sales, Profit, AOV, Profit Margin)
- Monthly trends
- Sales by Category
- Sales by Region
- Customer Segment filter

### 2. Product Performance

- Sales and profit by category and sub-category
- Discount vs Profitability scatter analysis
- Top 10 products by sales or profit

### 3. Customer Insights

- Sales by customer segment
- Customer profitability
- Repeat vs new customer performance

## Key Findings

1. Technology is the highest-revenue category, while Office Supplies generates lower profit due to discounts.
2. The West region represents the largest share of revenue.
3. Sales and profit increase over the years with seasonal spikes in November and December.
4. Consumer customers make the most purchases, but Corporate and Home Office customers show higher average order values.

(A more detailed summary is available in the insights PDF.)
